# AI-Room-Describer
 A library for using prompts to create descriptive text. By default it uses OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo to describe a room from a short label like "A Forest in Daytime".

 To use this you need to install the OpenAI python library using:
 `
 pip install openai
 `

 Then you need to put your OpenAI API Key in the "openai_api_key.txt" file in the project folder.

 After that, you should be able to run ai.py from the terminal in the project folder with:
 `
 python ai.py
 `
This library is meant as a starting point. You can look at the end of the ai.py file to see 
how the example works.
